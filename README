This is as close a port as I could manage of the camouflage-inspired (and inexplicably named) Glitterbomb theme for TextMate. Due to some fundamental differences in the way the two editors handle syntax highlighting, it's more or less impossible to make it a perfect match, but it's close enough to look fairly nice in most circumstances.

By the way, the original can be found on the TextMate wiki: http://wiki.macromates.com/Themes/UserSubmittedThemes
